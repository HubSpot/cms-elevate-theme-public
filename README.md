# Elevate - HubSpot Default CMS Theme

Elevate is HubSpot's default CMS theme, designed to provide a modern, flexible, and customizable foundation for building beautiful websites on the HubSpot CMS platform.

Because this theme is built using HubSpot's project based theme framework, it does not appear inside of the design manager. This repository is designed to give developers access to the source code so that they can easily customize the theme to suit their needs, use it to create a child theme of Elevate, or just use it as a reference for building custom themes.

## Overview

Elevate is built with modern development practices in mind, utilizing:
- Vite for fast and efficient builds
- PostCSS for modern CSS processing
- HubL templating for dynamic content
- TypeScript support
- Built-in testing with Vitest

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version specified in `.node-version`)
- [HubSpot CLI](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/local-development-cli)

## Development

The theme uses HubSpot's local development server for real-time preview of your changes. When you run `npm run start` or `yarn yarn-start`, you can view your changes at the local development URL provided by the CLI.

## Creating a child theme based on Elevate

Building a child theme is a great way to extend the functionality of Elevate without having to modify the core theme files. This can be done in either design manager or using the unified theme framework.

### Design manager

1. Create a new theme in design manager
2. Select "Use blank theme as starting point"
3. Modify the theme.json file to include `"extends": "@hubspot/elevate"`
4. Copy Elevate's theme fields.json file (`src/unified-theme/fields.json`) to the root of your new theme.
5. Add your custom code to the `src/unified-theme` directory.

### Unified theme framework

1. From your cli run `npx @hubspot/create-cms-theme`
2. Follow the prompts to create a blank unified theme project
3. Modify the theme.json file to include `"extends": "@hubspot/elevate"`
4. Copy Elevate'stheme fields.json file (`src/unified-theme/fields.json`) to the root of your new theme.

### Notable items

In order to override parent theme files from a child theme, you need to ensure that the file you are trying to override exists at the same path in both themes and has the same file name.


## Contributing

Note that this theme is maintained by HubSpot. It is configured to sync with an internal repository and was built so that developers can have access to the source code as the theme itself is not available in the design manager.

No PR's will be accepted / merged in here. Instead, we recommend creating issues.

Open issues if you notice any bugs or have feature requests (unofficially supported) -- however, if you notice impactful bugs, the recommended way to get them fixed is to open a ticket with HubSpot's support team (officially supported).
